# vexv5_23-24

I wrote this during my Senior year, and this code enables both driver control where a person with a controller can move the robot, and autonomous control where the robot has been given a set list of instructions.

Main.cpp is the main file which contains all of the important code.

This project is not fully up to date and does not run.
